/**
 This programm simulates someone who listens to the orchestra. This application has two responsibilities.
 Firstly, it must listen to Musicians and keep track of active musicians. 
 A musician is active if it has played a sound during the last 5 seconds. 
 Secondly, it must make this information available to you. 
 Concretely, this means that it should implement a very simple TCP-based protocol.
